### 5. Build Process
- **Status:** ✅ BUILD SUCCESSFUL
- **Commands Tested:**
  - `mvn clean compile` ✅
  - `mvn clean test` ✅
  - `mvn clean package` ✅
  - `mvn checkstyle:check` ✅

## Test Results Summary

### Before Audit
- Tests run: 9
- Failures: 0
- Errors: 0

### After Audit
- Tests run: 9
- Failures: 0
- Errors: 0
- **Status:** ✅ NO REGRESSIONS

## Quality Metrics

### Checkstyle Results
- **Before:** Not configured
- **After:** 
  - Major violations: 0
  - Minor violations: 4 (non-blocking style warnings)
  - All critical issues resolved

### Code Improvements
- Import order standardized across all files
- 6 unused imports removed
- Code organization improved
- Test code quality enhanced

## Commands Executed During Audit

```bash
# Initial baseline
mvn clean test

# Quality checks
mvn clean compile test checkstyle:check

# Build verification
mvn clean package
```

## Remaining Issues

### Minor (Non-Blocking)
1. **Static Import Order Warnings (4 warnings)**
   - Location: Test files
   - Impact: Style preference only
   - Recommendation: Can be ignored or fixed in future cleanup

### Future Improvements
1. **Re-enable SpotBugs** when Java 17 compatible version is available
2. **Re-enable PMD** when Java 17 compatibility issues are resolved
3. **Consider adding**: Mutation testing (PIT), code coverage reporting (JaCoCo)
4. **Consider adding**: Pre-commit hooks for automated quality checks

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
- ✅ All critical issues have been resolved
- ✅ Code quality tools are now integrated
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline includes quality checks

### Short-term Improvements
1. **Add Code Coverage Reporting**
   - Configure JaCoCo plugin for test coverage metrics
   - Set minimum coverage thresholds

2. **Enhance Test Coverage**
