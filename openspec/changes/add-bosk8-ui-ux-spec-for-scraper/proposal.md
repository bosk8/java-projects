## Why
The Simple Web Scraper currently provides a powerful CLI without a unified, production-ready UI/UX specification. Teams need a consistent, accessible, and brand-aligned interface to configure runs, monitor executions, and review/export data. This proposal delivers a complete UI/UX system strictly adhering to `style.md` (Bosk8 design), enabling rapid implementation and consistent developer handoff.

## What Changes
- Define an end-to-end UI/UX system for the scraper (web admin UI + CLI UX alignments) strictly using tokens and patterns from `style.md`.
- Add capabilities specs for: `ui-system`, `component-library`, `navigation`, and `accessibility`.
- Provide screen-by-screen specs, IA, flows, and a Style Compliance Matrix with exact token references and derivations (when required).
- Produce developer handoff artifacts: tokens/CSS map, redlines, sample snippets, and an acceptance checklist.

## Impact
- Affected specs: `ui-system`, `component-library`, `navigation`, `accessibility` (all ADDED).
- Affected code: future frontend implementation (new web UI), plus optional CLI help text refinements for parity with UI labels.
- No breaking changes to Java scraping core.

## Constraints
- Single source of truth for visual/interaction is `style.md`. No new tokens or palettes; derivations must be explicitly recorded in Style Decisions Log.
- Accessibility: WCAG 2.2 AA.

## References
- Style authority: `style.md`
- Backend behavior: `Simple-Web-Scraper` README, RUNBOOK, and `pom.xml` for packaging constraints.
